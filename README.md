# Vanilla Javascript Taskilist

It's just a simple tasklist, with a kinda minimalistic design. There's not much to expect.  

Here are some of the most _cool_ and _innovative_ features of this taskilist:

- Add new tasks WOOOOW!! SO AWESOME!!!!!
- Mark tasks as finished OMGG
- Delete tasks WOOOHOOOO
- Delete all tasks at once with a bin button (Ok, enough)
- Unfinish tasks (having to do this irl is kinda disappointing, but just in case)
- Delete all finished tasks with a button that looks exacty the same as the another one
- Filter the current tasks
- All the changes are automagically saved in your browser's local storage

### Bonus
*Low budget animations on the icons* -- I know, that's awesome

Aaaand that's all

If you're curious, I used Nunito Sans for the normal text and Bebas Neue for the headings.
